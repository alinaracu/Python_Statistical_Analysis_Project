# Statistics Python Analysis Project

What makes a song popular? Is it its energy? Tempo? Perhaps the positivity it conveys? Or its ability to make people stand up and dance? 

In this case study, we will be exploring whether there is a "success recipe" for songs and whether there are certain patterns in music features. 

Exploratory research questions:

* What is the regional distribution of song streams on Spotify?
* Is there a relationship between ranking position or number of streams and music features?
* Are there any specific features that make some songs more popular than other?
